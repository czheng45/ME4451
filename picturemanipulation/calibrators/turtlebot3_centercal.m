function [factor] = turtlebot3_centercal(img,velpub,velmsg,varargin)
%Calculates the ratio of distance from the BIG blue calibrator to the SMALL
%blue calibrator that marks the turning center of the turtlebot.

%spins the turtlebot, taking images periodically, to calculate the
%intersection of the lines between the blue calibrator circles, which is
%the turning center of the turtlebot.

%---start spinning and stuff---

%---take pictures every XX degrees---
